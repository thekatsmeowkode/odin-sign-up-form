# odin-sign-up-form


The goal for this project is to create a signup form for a fictional service as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The objective is to create a form that responds to valid and invalid inputs. I took it a bit further to learning about some principles of design and making an aesthetically pleasing page along the way.

Areas of learning focus:

Color wheel theory
Free stock image resources on the web & how to properly credit to artists
Use of pseudoclasses
More complex CSS selector usages integrated
How to link external custom fonts to project using Google Fonts and downloading files/generating webkit
Be mindful of accessibility features - very interested in this topic because of relevance to jobs
How to integrate Javascript into form validation and password matching
